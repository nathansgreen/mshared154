Manifest Sections

 The <<<\<manifestSections\>>>> element provides a way to add custom manifest
 sections. It contains a list of
 <<<\<{{{../index.html#class_manifestSection}manifestSection}}\>>>> elements.

 <<Note:>> As with all the examples here, this configuration can be used in all
 plugins that use Maven Archiver, not just maven-jar-plugin as in this example.

 Given this configuration:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId>
        ...
        <configuration>
          <archive>
            <manifestSections>
              <manifestSection>
                <name>foo</name>
                <manifestEntries>
                  <id>nice foo</id>
                </manifestEntries>
              </manifestSection>
              <manifestSection>
                <name>bar</name>
                <manifestEntries>
                  <id>nice bar</id>
                </manifestEntries>
              </manifestSection>
            </manifestSections>
          </archive>
        </configuration>
        ...
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

 The following content will end up in the manifest:

+-----+
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Archiver-Version: Plexus Archiver
Created-By: Apache Maven
Built-By: ${user.name}
Build-Jdk: ${java.version}

Name: foo
id: nice foo

Name: bar
id: nice bar
